          <h1>Demos</h1>
          <p>These demos are a collection of projects that I've built while learning different types of development. Most projects will be webapp or game related, but I'm currently learning more frontend development to add to the collection. You can check my stuff out at the links below.</p>
          <p><strong>Important Unity Note: </strong>After opening a Unity demo, you must click the Unity window for sound and control. Unity's web player is not built for Mobile.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Emily AI is a Slack App that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to messages in Slack. Emily AI is built using JavaScript, Node, Express. Axios, and MongoDB. The build explicitly avoids Slack's Bolt SDK in order to show familiarity working with Express, OAuth, Signature Verification, and Slack's API directly.</p>
          <p>Emily's memory is stored in a MongoDB database along with the encrypted Access Token for your Slack workspace. Access Tokens are encrypted using the Node Crypto library and the AES-256-GCM algorithm. Tokens are fetched and decrypted at runtime during the specific API call being made to Slack.</p>
          <p>Emily AI is in active development and you can find the project's Github repo here: <a href="https://github.com/jalder89/Emily-AI-GPT3">https://github.com/jalder89/Emily-AI-GPT3</a></p>

          <p>A short sci-fi adventure game by Jess & Ward built in two weeks for Adventure Jam 2023.</p>
          <p>Solar Sub 1, the first sub-surface solar observation station deployed into the sun two weeks ago. Solely staffed by robots, the station&CloseCurlyQuote;s goal is to send back valuable data regarding the inner-workings of our star.</p>
          <p>The initial readings left scientists baffled, suggesting that the sun's density is significantly lower than previously anticipated.</p>
          <p>Shortly after, all communications ceased...</p>

          </div>
          <p>A simple game where you are given a deck of cards to match. The game will track how long it takes for you to complete and provide a score. Time doesn't affect your score but the number of moves that you make will.</p>

          <p>The endless runner is a very simply runner game from when I first started learning Unity. The player has to jump to avoid obstacles with the space bar and the game ends if you hit an obstacle. Currently you'll need to refresh your browser to try again.</p>
