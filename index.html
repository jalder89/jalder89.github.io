          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hey there, my name is Jess! I'm an aspiring code polyglot, mentor, technology advocate, and I'm a proud trans-woman.</p>
          <p>If it bleeps, blips, bloops, does computations, runs software, or just basically mind boggles most people, then I'm probably into it. I spend a lot of time self-educating and helping others grow in the tech space. My journey started when I hit my teenage years, and I found an obsession in computers, consoles, and electronics. I found myself ripping apart every piece of technology I had trying to figure out how it worked, what might be causing issues, or just to try and upgrade it to something better.</p>
          <p>I'm also an avid musician and game geek. I play guitar, drums, and bass. I'm an aspiring Game Designer working with Unity. I've been known to dabble in Photoshop, ZBrush, and Maya as well. My overall goal is to bring back the old values of game design and to bring world-class entertainment to people around the globe.</p>
