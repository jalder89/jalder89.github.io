## [Portfolio Site] (jalder89.github.io)

The site is a portfolio site I built working through the Udacity Front-end nanodegree. I'm not a designer, so it is a bit 90s internet in looks, but it has an interactive nav bar and some pages about me. I also host it on github pages so that my Unity game demos can be easily found online. I'm currently learning bootstrap and hoping to update the design in the future.

## Games

The games are a collection of small projects I've built on my own or through classes with Unity or Udacity.

### Retro Wave Rider

A demo of a parallax scene I through together in about a day for a fellow indie developer in Unity. You have to click the Unity window for sound, but the demo features music, parallax backgrounds, and an animated car that you can move with A & D.

The demo can be found here: https://jalder89.github.io/retrowaverider 

### Memory Game

The memory game is a simple game where you are given a deck of cards to match. The game will track how long it takes for you to complete and provide a score. Time doesn't affect your score but the number of moves that you make will.

### Clicky Fruit

Clicky Fruit is a game similar to fruit ninja where you have to click fruits and items that fly on screen while avoiding the random bombs. This game features a score UI and restart functionality.

### Endless Runner

The endless runner is similar to other runner games where you have to jump to avoid obstacles with the space bar. Currently you'll need to refresh your browser to try again.
