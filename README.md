## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Games

The games are a collection of small projects I've built in a few Unity courses and through Udacity.

You'lle find these games here:
1. A memory game: https://wbarnes1989.github.io/memory
2. An endless runner: https://wbarnes1989.github.io/prototype-3
3. A clicky fruit game: https://wbarnes1989.github.io/prototype-5


The memory game is a simple game where you are given a deck of cards to match. The game will track how long it takes for you to complete and provide a score.
Time doesn't affect your score but the number of moves that you make will.

The endless runner is similar to other runner games where you have to jump to avoid obstacles with the space bar. Currently you'll need to refresh your browser to try again.

Clicky Fruit is a game similar to fruit ninja where you have to click fruits and items that fly on screen while avoiding the random bombs. This game features a score UI and restart functionality.
